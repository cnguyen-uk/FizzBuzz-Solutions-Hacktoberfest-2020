# FizzBuzz Solutions (Hacktoberfest 2020)
*An archive for personal contributions to a FizzBuzz Hacktoberfest 2020 repository.*

As part of Hacktoberfest 2020, I contributed some unique, first and only solutions to the FizzBuzz problem in [this](https://github.com/NLDev/Hacktoberfest-2020-FizzBuzz) repository, by [NLDev](https://github.com/NLDev).

The purpose of this repository is simply to archive my own solutions, in the case that the aforementioned repository disappears.

## The FizzBuzz Problem

From [Tom Dalling's blog](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/fizzbuzz-in-too-much-detail/), FizzBuzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Solutions

Of course, FizzBuzz is a widely known and commonly solved problem. Furthermore, the Hacktoberfest 2020 repository already had plenty of creative solutions in popular programming languages. My aim was to contribute something different - to create solutions in languages that weren't meant for it, namely [LaTeX](https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/Getting-Started-With-LaTeX) and [VBA](https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/An-Introduction-to-VBA). In particular, LaTeX is meant for typesetting documents rather than scripting, and VBA is only really meant for use with Excel.

Solutions in LaTeX already exist elsewhere on GitHub, but did not exist in the repository. My LaTeX solutions (including a one-liner) can be seen [here](https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/FizzBuzz-Solutions-Hacktoberfest-2020/tree/main/LaTeX).

Similarly for VBA, plenty of solutions exist for VBA with Excel. However, **no** solutions seem to exist for VBA with Access, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher or Word. This makes sense because these pieces of Microsoft Office software are the least popular to use VBA with. In fact, I claim that I have created the first, and only, FizzBuzz solutions for those five pieces of software. My VBA solutions for the full Microsoft Office software (which have an inbuilt VBA engine) can be seen [here](https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/FizzBuzz-Solutions-Hacktoberfest-2020/tree/main/VBA).
